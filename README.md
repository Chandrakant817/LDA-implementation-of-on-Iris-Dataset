# LDA-implementation-on-Iris-Dataset (With Brief Information of LDA)
Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) implementation on Iris Dataset

> LDA tries to solve Supervised Clasification Problem wherein the objective is not to understand variability of the data,but to maximize the separation known categories.
> In LDA the covariance matrix is substituted by a scatter matrix which captrues the characteristics between class and within class.
